I have created a landing page for leisure management, using Figma.
It helps you to track your time, monitors the distribution of activities, and intelligently suggests personalized entertainment. You can even get reward points!
In my webpage you can see three different features:
 a) click on menu icon so that the menu bar pops up
 b) click on any of the given show icons to give a bigger view
 c) click on scroll down to move the extention of landing page
 d) search icon that will enable search bar
