### Theme :
Is a platform that allows users to access all their curated kinds of entertainment in one place. Which has webtoons (digital comics), books, and Asian TV shows!

What makes this platform better is that, it also has an inbuilt _**Pomodoro Timer**_ that helps you track and set your time limits, which ensures you don't get carried away.  

It is designed in such a way that the users will *Gain Points* as they complete tasks that are tailored for every user!

### Motivation :
These days getting the free time to enjoy our favorite type of entertainment has become a luxury and by the time are gifted with that, we end up exhausting it on finding and choosing what to do! 

This problem arises not only because we are flooded with numerous forms of entertainment but also since all forms are not availabe at the same place! 

Not only this but since most of the time we get carried away and we dont adhere to the time limit we set for yourselves. Leading to us missing out on many important things that we have to do. 

Also, when I ask people who love reading books but are unable to so, they tell me that all the above problems and they end up dropping the hobby of reading books completely. 
 
Since I have faced such problems like these and after hearing such kind of experiences it motivated me to come up with Leisurious.

Also builting, it in a game like manner with coins and many more will motivate people to adhere to the there prefixed time limit. 

So Leisurious is a place where we get the best of all worlds.

The landing page was made in such a way so that the user can view the recent top hits in just the opening page. But also by just clicking the tiles it will directly take the user to the main page of the book/series/comics. 

### Future Improvements :
Leisurious is an AI-enabled platform that so future improvements would be the following :
<!-- UL -->
