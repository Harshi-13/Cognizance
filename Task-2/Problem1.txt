This program will allow user to find whether a number is divisible by 3 with a response as "true" or "false"

Divisor = 0
temp1 = 0
temp2 = 0
myNumber = INPUT "Enter the number you wish to find divisibility by 3"
DO 
	myNumber = myNumber - 3
UNTIL ( myNumber = 0 or myNumber = 1 or myNumber = 2 )

IF (myNumber = 0)
	OUTPUT "TRUE"
ELSE 
	OUTPUT "FALSE"
END IF
